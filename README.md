#### How to Get a GitHub Token

1. **Sign in to GitHub**:
   - Go to the GitHub website (github.com) and sign in to your account.

2. **Access Personal Access Tokens settings**:
   - Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner of the page.
   - Select "Settings" from the dropdown menu.
   - In the left sidebar, click on "Developer settings".
   - Then click on "Personal access tokens".

3. **Generate a new token**:
   - Click on the "Generate new token" button.
   - You may need to enter your GitHub password for confirmation.
   - Give your token a descriptive name.
   - Select the scopes or permissions for your token. For your use case, you might need `repo` scope if you want to access repositories.
   - Click on "Generate token".

4. **Copy the token**: Once the token is generated, copy it immediately. GitHub will not show it again.

5. **Store the token securely**: Treat your token like a password. Store it securely, and avoid sharing it publicly.

6. **Use the token in your application**: Now, you can use this token in your application for GitHub API authentication.
